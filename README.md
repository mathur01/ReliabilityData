# ReliabilityData
In order to conduct the experiment, a single tank pilot plant was designed in a simulation environment and iterate the process for random hours with random gate valve opening. Further, after acquiring the data, the data processing and cleaning was performed, in which the data was split into three (3) category, the first (1) category was to record the number of hours(time) the process had run. The second (2) category failure event is recorded, which defines the occurrence of failure due to stiction at a certain operating time. The last third (3) category sets the rate of flow based on the set point of simulated process plants. The collection of all this defines the failure in control valve operation in process plants.
